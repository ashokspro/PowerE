## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### üìã Prerequisites

- üêç Python 3.7 or higher
- üì¶ Required dependencies (see `requirements.txt`)

### üîß Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ashokspro/PowerE.git
cd PowerE
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Command Line Interface (Headless Mode)

Run the application in background mode without GUI:

```bash
python PowerE.py
```

This mode is ideal for:
- Server deployments
- Background automation
- Scheduled system tasks
- Continuous operation without user interaction

### Graphical User Interface

Launch the application with GUI for interactive scheduling:

```bash
python PowerE.py --head
```

The GUI provides:
- Visual task scheduling interface
- Real-time status monitoring
- Easy configuration management
- Interactive timing controls

### Executable Distribution

For systems without Python installed, use the provided executable:

#### Windows

1. **Headless Mode**: Double-click `POWER-E.exe` or run from command prompt
2. **GUI Mode**: Use the provided batch file or run:
```cmd
POWER-E.exe --head
```

Or use the convenience batch file:
```cmd
PowerE_GUI.bat
```

#### Auto-Start Setup (Windows)

To run PowerE automatically at system startup:

1. **Press `Win + R`** and type `shell:startup`, then press Enter
2. **Copy `POWER-E.exe`** to the startup folder that opens
3. **Create a shortcut** (optional) and modify properties to add `--head` argument for GUI mode

This ensures PowerE runs automatically when Windows starts, perfect for continuous background automation.


## Scheduling Tasks

### Via GUI
1. Launch the application with `--head` argument
2. Use the scheduling interface to set up your tasks
3. Configure timing, frequency, and other parameters
4. Save and activate your schedule

## Development

### Running from Source

```bash
# Headless mode
python main.py

# GUI mode
python main.py --head
```

### Building Executable

[Add instructions for building the executable using PyInstaller or similar]

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed PowerE.py
```
